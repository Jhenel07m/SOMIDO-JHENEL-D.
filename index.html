              <h3><br>Verse 1:</br> </h3><p style="color:Blue;">I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home</p>
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh

            <h3><br>Chorus 1: </br></h3><p style="color:Blue;">Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            I need you here to stay</p>
            I broke all my bones that day I found you
            Crying at the lake
            Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
            Oh, and if I could take it all back
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide

            <h3><br>Bridge 1:</br></h3> <p style="color:Blue;">Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
            I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
            Listen close, it's a no
            The wind is a-pounding on my back
            And I found hope in a heart attack
            Oh at last, it has passed
            Now I've got it, and you can't have it</p>
            <h3><br>Chorus 2: </br></h3>Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            I need you here to stay
            I broke all my bones that day I found you
            Crying at the lake
            Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
            And if I could take it all back
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide
            Darling, when I'm fast asleep
            I've seen this person watching me
            Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
            Oh
            <p style="color:Blue;">'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
            There is nothing in between
            And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
            Watching over me, he's singing</p>
         
            <h3><br> Bridge 2: </br></h3>"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
            He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
            Oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
            I need you here to stay
            I broke all my bones that day I found you
            Crying at the lake
            <p style="color:Blue;">Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
            And if I could take it all back
            I swear that I would pull you from the tide</p>
